CSTBox development tools and libraries
======================================

This repository gathers all the tools and internal libraries you need to modify
CSTBox components or develop your own.

Although more natural, you don't need to clone it in the same tree as the rest
of CSTBox components sources, and you can locate it anywhere you prefer. 

Whatever is your choice, you will need to perform the following settings on your 
environment :

  - define the CSTBOX_DEVEL_HOME environment variable and set it to contain the
  path where you placed this repository on your system

  - optionally, but strongly advised, add $CSTBOX_DEVEL_HOME/bin to the search
  path for executables. This will relieve you from specifying the full path of
  tools when you'll need tu use them
